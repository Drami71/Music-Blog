 <h2> 2020 In Rock </h2>

  <header><h3>Nine Inch Nails-Ghosts V: Together/Ghosts VI: Locusts</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2020-03-26">Released March 26, 2020</time>
  <p>Parts 5 and 6 of the <i>Ghosts</i> saga were released simultaneously, offering
  a clear contrast between the two. Both volumes feel more concentrated compared to
  the original quartet released back in 2008. <i>Together</i> has a more hopeful, often
  comforting sound. <i>Locust</i>on the other hand has a more dread, anxiety inducing sound.
  Emblamatic of the time that these two albums were released, they feel right at home.</p>

   <header><h3>Waxahatchee-Saint Cloud</h3></header>
   <time datetime="2020-03-27">Released March 27, 2020</time>
   <p>The new album is often not one you're expecting. The imagery
   used evokes one of warmness yet it is an album speaking of one's
   suffering and trying to overcome addiction. One who is trying to
   better themselves, something that will happen numerous times
   in our lifetimes. It's an album that embraces just how difficult
   and messy growing up and taking responsibility for one's own
   actions can be.</p>

  <header><h3>The Strokes-The New Abnormal</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2020-04-10">Released April 10, 2020</time>
  <p>Their first album in seven years and arguably their best in 15 years,
  The Strokes have found their old groove again. Using their old techniques
  of incorporating 80's synthpop, they tap into an old nostalgia. This album isn't 
  revolutionary but its an enjoyable album with catchy tunes and a return to form
  for The Strokes.</p>

  <header><h3>Enter Shikari-Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2020-4-17">Released April 17, 2020</time>
  <p><i>Nothing Is True & Everything Is Permitted</i> feels like a natural endpoint
  for Enter Shikari. Their genre-hopping sound feels like it's come full-circle and
  pays tribute to their entire discography. Ranging from the synthpop to their punk-rock
  days, it's an album of ideas and experimentation that's more ambitious than 
  anything they have ever attempted.</p>
