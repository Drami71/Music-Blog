  <header><h3>Slipknot-We Are Not Your Kind</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-08-9">Released August 9, 2019</time>
  <p><i>We Are Not Your Kind</i> feels like the album Slipknot has been trying to make
  since <i>Vol. 3</i>. From the gutteral guitars to the vocals to the use of 
  synthesizers to bring out the somber atmosphere, Slipknot has crafted an intense listen
  from start to end. One can't help out but single out Corey Taylor's incredible performance, 
  both vocally and lyrically. Finally shedding off the notion that they can't replicate
  their first two albums, Slipknot has created a new identity that will be exciting to see
  where they go next.</p>

  <header><h3>Tool-Fear Inoculum</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-08-30">Released August 30, 2019</time>
  <p>Tool’s long-awaited new album turns out to be well worth the wait. While
  there are hints of their older writing, the band has evolved with the
  instrumentalists laying down some of their most impressive and technical
  performances. From the guitar melody in Invincible to the vocals on
  Descending, Tool hasn’t lost a step after all these years. This album
  rewards patience. Each track is multilayered and at times feels like they
  don't follow the traditional structure for a song. But then again, this
  is Tool we are talking about so it should come as no surprise.</p>

  <header><h3>Cult of Luna-Dawn to Fear</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-09-20">Released September 20, 2019</time>
  <p>On their eighth studio album, Cult of Luna tread familiar ground but
  at the same take a different shape. After Julie Christmas’s collaboration on 
  their previous album <i>Mariner</i>, Cult of Luna had a lot to live up to. This time
  around, they created a slower, moodier album leaves them more space to work on
  more hypnotic riffs, twisting them into different forms until there is nothing left.
  A dense album that demands the attention of the listener, the runtime of nearly 80
  minutes leaves you feeling like you went on a journey into the vulernabilities of
  mankind.</p>

  <header><h3>Opeth-In Caude Venenum</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-09-27">Released September 27, 2019</time>
  <p>Continuing down a different, often controversial path from their original sound, Opeth
  keeps following their new path incorporating a more folkish progressive
  rock to their previous heavy metal upbringings. Creating an album that incorporates
  some of their old sound, their are some more heavier moments interwoven among the
  slower, more melodic melodies. Releasing two different versions with English and 
  Swedish vocals, one may be tempted to just listen to the English version. However,
  their is something about how the Swedish vocals feeds off the instrumentaion
  that warrants a listen.</p>

   <header><h3>Blood Incantation-Hidden History of the Human Race</h3></header>
   <time datetime="2019-11-19">Released November 11, 2019</time>
   <p>On their second full length album, Blood Incantation release quite arguably the decades defining
   death metal album. Creating such a psychedelic trip that runs at just 36 minutes across
   4 tracks, it wastes no time in creating a weird atmosphere with riffs that 
   spans the entirety of death metal. Not only paying homage to old death metal bands like
   Death and Cannibal Corpse, they incorporate a more modern, progressive sound found 
   in a band like Mastodon. In the end, they are able to morph these two styles into something truly
   special, quite arguably not just the best death metal album of the year but of the decade.</p>
