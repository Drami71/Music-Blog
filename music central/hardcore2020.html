 <h2> 2020 In Hardcore</h2>

  <header><h3>Higher Power-27 Miles Underwater</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-01-25">Released January 24, 2020</time>
  <p>The second album out of the English hardcore band treads familiar
  ground with much of their contemporaries, but that's not quite a bad thing.
  It's a wonderful mix of hardcore, grunge and 90s indiie rock, which sounds
  like a weird mix but in the end it works. From the musicianship to Jimmy Wizards
  wonderfully eclectic vocal performance, this album will surely be a mainstay for
  the entire year.</p>

  <header><h3>Envy-The Fallen Crimson</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-02-5">Released February 5, 2020</time>
  <p>Having been around the hardcore scene for almost 30 years, Envy
  are no strangers. They've been masters at mixing the harshness of hardcore
  with post-rock for decades. This album sounds overwhelming at points jumping
  from section to section. The album itself feels like a tide is washing over you
  and at this point in their careers it's something we've come to expect.</p>

   <header><h3>Code Orange-Underneath</h3></header>
   <time datetime="2020-03-13">Released March 13, 2020</time>
   <p>This time around, Code Orange continue fusing their metallic
   and melodic sides with electronic elements. Introducing a more industrial
   synthetic sound mixed with their usual chaotic, often mathematical approach,
   Code Orange has paved a new road. Each track cleanly flows off each other,
   going from a heavy to a more melodic track. It can be a little in your face at times
   but at the end of the day this is a hardcore album after all.</p>

  <header><h3>The Chats-High Risk Behaviour</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-03-27">Released March 27, 2020</time>
  <p>The Chats pull off something most bands can't: creating a carefree,
  sardonic record that sounds so natural and real. The Chats are a band 
  that always focuses on having a good time, often in a juvenile way. Tracks don't run
  past the two-minute mark which helps to keep a steady flow. The Chats don't care about breaking
  down barriers, they just want to have fun.</p>
