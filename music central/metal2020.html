  <header><h3>Sepultura-Quadra</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2020-02-7">Released February 7, 2020</time>
  <p>Sepultura releases arguably their best album in decades. <i>Quadra</i>
  feels like their first album that stands toe to toe with their original
  trilogy. The orchestras at place in the album help to counterbalance
  the heaviness we've come to expect. Sepultura are back and better
  than ever.</p>

  <header><h3>Psychotic Waltz-The God-Shaped Void</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2020-02-14">Released February 14, 2020</time>
  <p>The first album in almost 24 years is here and shows how the band
  hasn't lost any steam. Arguably one of the best prog metal bands of the
  90's, their new album show a slight evolution of their sound without
  losing any of the eccentric takes on metal that made them so prominent.
  Heavy riffing, aggressive vocals and complex time signatures, this album
  will be at the forefront of the conversation in the prog-metal community.</p>

   <header><h3>Old Man Gloom-Seminar IX:Darkness of Being</h3></header>
   <time datetime="2020-03-23">Released March 23, 2020</time>
   <p>On a surprise digital release, Old Man Gloom come out swinging
   with a emotional album as a tribute for their fallen friend.
   Branching off their previous records, Old Man Gloom make a
   record with incredible melodies that serve as a great contrast
   with the ensuing heavy riffs. Seminar IX feels like their most
   complete record to date and an excellent addition to the near
   flawless discography.</p>

  <header><h3>Igorr- Spirituality and Distortion</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2020-03-27">Released March 27, 2020</time>
  <p>Igorr has never shyed away from creating avant-garde music with
  such flair. With an increased focus on songwriting this time around,
  Igorr have managed to create a compelling album from start to finish with all
  the lunacy that is already expected. From baroque styles to electronic influences
  to thrashing metal, it's certainly a journey one won't forget. Not an easy listen,
  but one that is worthwhile for those willing to take the plunge.</p>
