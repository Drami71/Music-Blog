  <header><h3>Angel Dust-Pretty Buff</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-03-15">Released March 15, 2019</time>
  <p>Listening to <i>Pretty Buff</i> for the first time might leave you scratching
  your head given Angel Dust's first two albums. While not quick as fast-paced punk
  rock that we are accustomed to, <i>Pretty Buff</i> shows a evolution for the band.
  Songs are allowed to breathe more and tracks feel more connected than before. There's
  nothing bombastic or grandeous anout the album- just 13 great, easy to listen songs, each
  crafted with such honesty and care.</p>

  <header><h3>Knocked Loose-A Different Shade of Blue</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-08-23">Released August 23, 2019</time>
  <p>After announcing their arrival with their fantastic first LP, Knocked Loose showed up
  with no restraints. On their explosive second LP, we see a more mature and focused band that has
  found their groove. An unrelenting album from beginning to end, its fast and heavy.
  With bigger riffs, meaty breakdowns and more fleshed out lyrics Knocked Loose shows
  that they’ll be a mainstay for years to come.</p>

  <header><h3>SeeYouSpaceCowboy-The Correlation Between Entrance and Exit Wounds</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-09-27">Released September 27, 2019</time>
  <p>On their proper debut LP, we see a band that is no longer just
  a breakdown frenzy writing squad. We see a growth in their songwriting
  highlighted through the instrumentation and lyrics. With songs that
  deal with survival in a world filled with constant oppoisition, loss
  and tragedy many other hardcore bands can't pull off this level of
  emotion and maturity this early in their careers.</p>

  <header><h3>Norma Jean-All Hail</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-10-25">Released October 25, 2019</time>
  <p>There's not much that can really be said about Norma Jean at this point. They
  are running like a well-oiled machine. After all these years they show
  why they are still atop the metalcore world. Everything is on display here: disgusting
  breakdowns, time signature switches galore and beautiful melodies. All Hail feels
  like the culmination of all the years of hard work since <i>Meridional</i> and its paid off.</p>

   <header><h3>Counterparts-Nothing Left to Love</h3></header>
   <time datetime="2019-11-1">Released November 1, 2019</time>
   <p>Considered to be at the forefront of the new wave of hardcore,
   Counterparts have attained a mass of loyal followers over the years.
   They are at this part in their career where it feels like they’ve
   reached their final form. All the different iterations of
   their sound over the years feels like they are equally represented and
   refined upon. Between the melodic breakdowns and Murphy’s
   tortured lyrics, Counterparts puts out another quality record.</p>
