  <header><h3>La Dispute-Panorama</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-3-22">Released March 22, 2019</time>
  <p>Ruminating on topics such as grief, loss, and death La Dispute
  take us on a journey. Seamlessly blending guitar, bass, and drums
  no one instrument takes center stage. Each bleed off the other and
  create a soft, moody sound. Dreyer comes out swinging and delivers a
  performance both vocally and lyrically. Always employing his style of
  spoken word, none can do the remarkable job that he did in displaying
  such a level of emotion and vulnerability.</p>

  <header><h3>American Football-American Football(LP3)</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-03-22">Released March 22, 2019</time>
  <p>This third album takes the Midwestern emo band into a slightly new direction.
  Exploring new concepts as each member is exploring newfound fatherhood, they
  decide to use aging as a way to conceal the trials and tribulations as something
  that can be only understood as genetic. Few bands can do what American Football has
  done for the better part of twenty years: effortlessly bleed in shoegaze and post-rock
  into emo to create an album that feeds off vibes more than feelings.</p>

   <header><h3>PUP-Morbid Stuff</h3></header>
   <time datetime="2019-04-5">Released April 5, 2019</time>
   <p>PUP continue their charm the third time around, creating an album
   containing all that we’ve fallen in  with over the years: nasally vocals,
   sarcastic and scathing lyrics and glorious punk riffs. With more vulnerable
   lyrics that we’ve never seen from Babcock, there’s no better example of a
   classic modern punk record than what PUP have been able to achieve. Keeping
   their iconic sound while showing signs of progressive growth, one can only
   think on what's to come next.</p>

  <header><h3>Frank Carter & the Rattlesnakes-End of Suffering</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-05-3">Released May 3, 2019</time>
  <p>Shedding off their hardcore roots, we see Frank Carter become a juggernaut
  rock band. Frank Carter has never shyed away from crafting songs with blunt
  but honest lyrics, tackling his personal demons. Highlights from the album include
  Tyrant Lizard King which has the old Frank Carter swag and Love Games which has 
  a monster riff that's too good to miss.</p>

  <header><h3>Thank You Scientist-Terraformer</h3></header>
  <time datetime="2019-06-14">Released June 14, 2019</time>
  <p>Sitting at 84 minutes, this album can be hard to digest at first with all
  the moving pieces from the seven-piece band. With longer song lengths, there
  is less time to build on each one and instead helps to showcase different styles
  within each song. All the chaotic moments might be too difficult for some but
  figuring out and dissecting each song is a worthwhile ride in one of the best
  albums of the year.</p>
